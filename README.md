Joefetch is a minimal neofetch-type script that I created and its goes like this as an example:

I have written this in Python it took me a couple of programming languages before I settled on Python

For now this script only works on Unix-Like systems (I do not know if I will port it to other platforms.) (I have yet to test it on BSD and macOS)

clone it:
(Make sure you have `git` installed)

`git clone https://github.com/kitfistofan7600/Joefetch`

`cd Joefetch`

To run it without installing:

`python3 joefetch.py`

To install:

Install pyinstaller (Required) (Make sure you have python3-pip or distro eqivalent installed)

`pip install pyinstaller` (if an error occurs add --break-system-packages to the syntax)

To make and install:
(Make sure you have `make` installed)

`make`

`sudo make install`

To test if it works run this in the bash prompt:

`joefetch`

It is currently not perfect
